# CANE_HackGT2019

This repo's purpose is to practice for HackGT

*NOTE*: if anything in this README doesn't look right or you do something different please edit.

Probably gonna follow this MERN stack tutorial: https://codingthesmartway.com/the-mern-stack-tutorial-building-a-react-crud-application-from-start-to-finish-part-1/

## Workflow

For this practice project:

- Make your own branch (since everyone is doing the same thing, but also when you're trying something new that might break something)
- Someone who is in charge of merging changes with master (probably Alex cause he made the repo ig) will verify the changes and then merge with master branch

In general:

- If you don't feel confident something is gonna work, make a new branch and then merge your changes into master branch
- DON'T COMMIT THOUSANDS OF FILES AT ONCE! That's not what version control is. This means use a proper gitignore so git knows what to ignore.

## IDEs and Code editors

### Code editor

My choice of editor is normally Visual Studio Code paired with the Live Share Extension, idk a lot of people use it and I do too. You can download VS Code at this [link][https://code.visualstudio.com/download].

LiveShare is like Google Docs but for code (except multiple people can't edit the file at the same time, otherwise the person that commits later will override changes from the previous person. LiveShare just shows who's editing what.

### IDE

As for an IDE, JetBrain's WebStorm is an IDE specifically for web development (particularly with Javascript), and it is very nice. If you use IntelliJ IDEA, it is basically the same thing except for JavaScript and Web Dev features. Apply for a student license this year to get the pro version, and you can get most of JetBrain's pro versions of IDEs for free! They are very nice (like really).
