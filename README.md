# CANE_HackGT2019

This repo's purpose is to practice for HackGT (feel free to edit what's here)

Probably gonna follow this MERN stack tutorial: https://codingthesmartway.com/the-mern-stack-tutorial-building-a-react-crud-application-from-start-to-finish-part-1/

WORKFLOW: make your own branch (since everyone is doing the same thing), and then someone who is in charge of merging changes with master (probably Alex cause he made the repo ig) will verify the changes and then merge with master branch

Also try using Visual Studio Code, and then install the Live Share Extension. It's like Google Docs but for code (except multiple people can't edit the file at the same time, otherwise the person that commits later will override changes from the previous person. LiveShare just shows who's editing what.
